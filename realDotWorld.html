        This is a blog [Meandering On]. <br>
        I used to want to plan my life intentionally. I used to talk slow. <br>
        Sometimes, I still do. <br>
        I wonder how you came to this place. I'm only getting this site started, though I've had the domain for 
        about a month. In writing this, I hope to hold myself to more of a schedule. Further, I hope that it helps
        me to live more authentically- or, openly. By sharing pieces of myself, I can recieve others in turn. 
        The first things that I want to put here are an array of colors on the "Projects" page, on the trucking 
        picture. When a color is clicked on, the background will change to match it, and in turn, you will see the 
        blend of the semi-transparent image and background, as it would appear on a shirt (the image's intended use).
        Further, I'm going to link my git repository, with my classwork and personal projects. Finally, I'm going to continue
        updating the site with basic navigation functionality and personalize it (often through images, which are 
        created by me unless noted otherwise). Thanks for being a part of this. <br>
